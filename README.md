FULL-STACK WEB DEVELOPER

As a web developer with a physical science background, I bring to coding an analytical mindset ideal for problem solving and efficiency. I enjoy creating algorithms and incorporating mathematical tools into things I create. In my experience, software development and math both transcend disciplinary categorization. There’s nothing that can’t be better understood through math, and there’s nothing that can’t be furthered and improved by JavaScript.

Skills: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, VueJS, Vuex, React, Redux, Angular.js, Node.js, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Bulma, Python, Django, Java, PHP, Wordpress, Pressable, Visual Basic .NET, HTML/CSS, SQL, Postgres, MySQL, R, MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica, APIs, OOP, TDD, MVC Frameworks, Git, Agile, Heroku, and AWS
